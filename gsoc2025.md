Add an AI-assistant to the Write Activity

Prerequisites

    Experience with Python
    Experience with Sugar activities
    Experience with LLMs/Chatbots

Description

Sugar pioneered peer editing in its Write Activity. However, the Write Activity has never had any serious support for grammar correction (just spell check) and none of the more recent developments around AI-assisted writing. The goal of this project is to add AI-assistance to the writing process: both in the form of providing feedback as to what has been written and making suggestions as to what might be written.

The challenge will be both in terms of workflow integration and UX.

Note: We require that you have Sugar setup and working, see sugar-desktop.
